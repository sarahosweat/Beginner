Absolute Beginner

Hi,

I am a hobbyst in graphic & web design. I thought programming was a little more simplified than this but I quickly learned I was simple minded to think that. I was actually searching for a complicated graphic design software & accidently stumbled upon GitHub. I have an unorthodox desire to learn & know absolutely everything. So Wish me luck on this new hobby.

Schooling Myself Journal Notes:

Did not understand why my recent commits or edits weren't showing up on the pull request page then I realized I did not create a branch off the master branch.
